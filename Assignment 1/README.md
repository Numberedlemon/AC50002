# AC50002 - Assignment 1

Assignment 1 is a D3.js assessment, which pulls data about UK towns from a remote server, and displays them and their associated data on a map. It uses HTML, and javascript.

Map data was retrieved using the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, or GDAL, and converted into TopoJSON format and finally GeoJSON format for displaying using D3.js. [bostocks](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) Proved greatly useful in my learning regarding this topic.
